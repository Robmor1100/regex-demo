# Title (replace with your title)

Regex, short for Regular expression, is a group of characters that create a search pattern. They can search, replace, and extract text based on their pattern.  

## Summary

Today I'm going to use "/^#?([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})$/" as my example, and I'm going to explain what is looking for and how.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
'^' is the start anchor witch indicates the start of the pattern.
### Quantifiers
'?' The question mark is a quantifier and in this case that question mark is saying that the character before is optional. So what the regex is looking for does not have to start with a '#' but is could. 
'{}' These curly brackets are also telling us that what we are looking for is given this constraint. In this example '{6}' is saying that the length could be 6 characters long and the '{3}' is saying that is couls alo be 3 characters long.
### Grouping Constructs
'([a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3})' The () in this example are grouping these two bracket expresstions together. So what we are looking for needs to match those two bracket expresstions.

### Bracket Expressions
'[a-f0-9]{6}|[a-f0-9]{3}' the brackets in this example are encasing the elements that need to fufill the quantifiers constraints.
### Character Classes
'a-f0-9' is saying that the pattern can contain letters from a-f and also numbers 0-9.
### The OR Operator
'|' is and or operator bassiclly the pattern can fufill the expresstion before or after it.
### Flags
'$" this is indicates the end of the expression.
### Character Escapes
Character escapes are characters that have special meanings like '\d' means any digit between 0 and 9.

In the end this Regular expression could mean a bunch of thins like '#fff' or '#123456'.
